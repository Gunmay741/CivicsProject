<h1 class="heading"> Spreading Awareness</h1>

<h2 class="paragraph"> Spreading awareness is important if one wants to implement change. Canada is a democratic country, 
    how will someone know to vote for someone who will implement change if they dont know that there is something that needs 
    to be changed? So, to spread awareness a global human trafficking day exists to spread awareness. On the 11th of January 
    people from all around the world spread awareness about human trafficking on this day. Wether it be a poster, a speech or 
    a website like this! On January 11th We acknoledge all hose who have been trafficked and we aim to stop it. </h2>
